## Relevant Files

- `src/app/races/[raceId]/page.tsx` - This will be the main page component for the race review page.
- `src/components/races/race-review-form.tsx` - A new component for the review submission form.
- `src/components/races/race-review-list.tsx` - A new component to display the list of reviews.

### Notes

- We will use a dynamic route `[raceId]` to represent a specific race page.
- New components will be created within a new `races` subdirectory inside `src/components` to keep the code organized.
