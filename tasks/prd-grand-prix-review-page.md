# Product Requirements Document: Grand Prix Review Page

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new feature: a dedicated page where users can review a specific Grand Prix race. The page will allow users to submit their own review and rating, and also view the reviews and ratings submitted by other users. The primary goal is to create a focused space for community feedback on individual races.

## 2. Goals

- To enable users to submit a textual review and a numerical/star rating for a specific Grand Prix.
- To allow users to view a collection of reviews for a specific race from other members of the community.
- To provide a simple, single-page experience focused on one race at a time.

## 3. User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to write a review and give a rating for a Grand Prix I watched, so that I can share my opinion with the community.
- **As a user**, I want to read reviews from other people for a specific race, so that I can see what others thought about it.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system must render a page for a single, specific Grand Prix race.
2.  The page must display the name of the Grand Prix as a prominent heading (e.g., "Austrian GP 2025").
3.  The page must contain a form for submitting a new review.
4.  The review form must include a text area for writing the review content.
5.  The review form must include a mechanism for providing a rating (e.g., star rating).
6.  Below the form, the page must display a list of all existing reviews for that specific race.
7.  Each review in the list should display the reviewer's name, the review text, and the rating they provided.
8.  The data for the race and its reviews will be sourced from mock data.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- A page or view that lists all Grand Prix races.
- User authentication or user-specific functionality (e.g., all reviews can be anonymous or have a hardcoded author name for now).
- The ability for users to edit or delete their submitted reviews.
- Advanced features like sorting or filtering the list of reviews.
- Backend logic for processing and storing new reviews. The form submission will not be functional in this iteration.

## 6. Design Considerations

- The UI must be built using the existing `shadcn/ui` component library to ensure visual consistency with the rest of the application.
- The overall layout, typography, and color scheme should adhere to the established theme of the site.
- The list of reviews should be presented in a clear, legible format (e.g., a vertical list of cards).

## 7. Technical Considerations

- The page will be populated using mock data which will be provided separately.
- The initial implementation will focus on statically rendering the UI based on the provided mock data.
- No database or backend integration is required for this phase.

## 8. Success Metrics

- The Grand Prix review page renders correctly without errors.
- The page heading dynamically displays the name of the mock race data provided.
- A review submission form is present and interactive on the page.
- A list of reviews from the mock data is displayed correctly on the page.

## 9. Open Questions

1.  What is the scale for the rating (e.g., 1-5 stars, 1-10 numerical score)?
2.  Should there be a character limit for the review text? If so, what is it?
